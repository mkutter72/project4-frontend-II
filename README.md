##Explanation of Technologies Used
I selected Mongo as my database because of it's flexibly.   I have still have major pieces of work I want to do and like the fact that I don't have to make all my design decisions up front.   I selected socket.io because if it's ease of use (coding along with the demo) and that it has been very popular on GitHub.

##Unsolved Problems/Major Hurdles
I am having intermitant problems with saving my conversations in the database.   Maybe an interaction wit socket.io and mongo
